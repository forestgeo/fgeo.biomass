[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo.biomass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo.biomass)
[![Coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/forestgeo/fgeo.biomass/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/forestgeo/fgeo.biomass?branch=master)
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/fgeo.biomass)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fgeo.biomass)

The goal of __fgeo.biomass__ is to calculate biomass using allometric equations from the __allodb__ package. 

## Warning

This package is not ready for research. This is work in progress and you are encouraged to try this package and suggest improvements but you should not trust the results yet.

## Installation

Install the development version of **fgeo.biomass**:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.biomass")
```

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(fgeo.biomass)
```

### Overview

```{r}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1
species <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_species

census_species <- census %>%
  add_species(species, "scbi")

census_species
```

```{r}
species_overwrites_genus <- c("species", "genus")

census_species %>% 
  allo_find() %>%
  allo_order(species_overwrites_genus) %>% 
  allo_evaluate()
```

### Step by step

```{r}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1

dbh_species <- census %>% 
  add_species(species, site = "scbi")

dbh_species

equations <- dbh_species %>% 
  allo_find()

equations
```

### General manipulation of equations

You can use general purpose tools to manipulate the nested dataframe of equations. For example:

```{r}
equations %>% 
  filter(eqn_type %in% c("species", "mixed_hardwood"))

# Same
equations %>% 
  slice(c(1, 3))

equations %>% 
  slice(c(1, 3)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

### Prioritize equations

You can prioritize available equations by setting the order in which equations of different types overwrite each other. Here is a toy example to show how this works.

* Toy data.

```{r}
toy_equations <- tibble::tribble(
  ~eqn,       ~dbh,  ~eqn_type, ~rowid, ~where,
  "dbh + 1",    10,  "species",      1, "rowid only in species",
  "dbh + 1",    10,  "species",      3, "rowid in both: lhs overwrites rhs",

  "dbh + 2",    10,  "genus",        2, "rowid only in genus",
  "dbh + 2",    10,  "genus",        3, "rowid in both: lhs overwrites rhs",
)
toy_equations

toy_nested <- toy_equations %>% 
  nest(-eqn_type)

toy_nested
```

* Alternative results (compare first rows). 

```{r}
species_overwrites_genus <- c("species", "genus")

allo_order(toy_nested, order = species_overwrites_genus)

genus_overwrites_species <- c("genus", "species")

allo_order(toy_nested, order = genus_overwrites_species)
```

### Provide custom equations

You may have your own equations. Use `as_eqn()` to ensure your data has the correct structure.

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Checks that the structure of your data isn't terriby wrong
# BAD
as_eqn("really bad data")
as_eqn(data.frame(1))

# GOOD
your_equations <- tibble::tibble(
  equation_id = c("000001"),
  site = c("scbi"),
  sp = c("paulownia tomentosa"),
  eqn = c("exp(-2.48 + 2.4835 * log(dbh))"),
  eqn_type = c("mixed_hardwood"),
  anatomic_relevance = c("total aboveground biomass")
)

class(as_eqn(your_equations))
```

You can now use the argument `custom_eqn` to pass your custom equations to `allo_find()`.

```{r}
allo_find(census_species, custom_eqn = as_eqn(your_equations))
```

This is what the entire workflow looks like:

```{r}
dbh_species %>%
  allo_find(custom_eqn = as_eqn(your_equations)) %>%
  allo_order() %>%
  allo_evaluate()
```

### Calculate biomass

Calculate biomass of a stem by evaluating each allometric equation based on  its corresponding `dbh`.

```{r}
best <- equations %>% 
  allo_order()

best

with_biomass <- best %>% 
  allo_evaluate()

with_biomass
```

Summarize the results as you would normally do with general purpose tools.

```{r}
with_biomass %>% 
  group_by(sp) %>% 
  summarize(total_biomass = sum(biomass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_biomass))
```

### Memoization

> If a function is called multiple times with the same input, you can often speed things up by keeping a cache of known answers that it can retrieve. This is called memoisation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization.

-- https://github.com/r-lib/memoise

Because `allo_evaluate()` can be slow, its result is stored and reused after the first time you run it.

```{r, cache=FALSE}
# Clear cache to show how it works
memoise::forget(allo_evaluate)

# `allo_evaluate()` may be slow the first time you run it
system.time(allo_evaluate(best))
memoise::is.memoised(allo_evaluate)

# Calls after the first one take almost no time
system.time(allo_evaluate(best))
```

### Known issues

Right now there may be multiple rows per `rowid`. This is because, for a single stem, there may be multiple equations to reflect the allometries of different parts of the stem. __fgeo.biomass__ doesn't handle this issue yet; it only helps you to find and remove the problematic equations.

```{r}
best %>% 
  fixme_find_duplicated_rowid()
```

Here you enter the danger zone. __fgeo.biomass__ provides a quick and dirty way of getting a single equation per stem: `fixme_drop_duplicated_rowid()` drops all rows where `rowid` appears more than once in the dataset.

```{r}
incomplete <- best %>% 
  fixme_drop_duplicated_rowid()

incomplete
```

Dropping useful equations is extreme but conservative. We hope to soon provide an easy way to sum biomass across multiple parts of a tree. Until then you will have to do it yourself.

```{r}
# No longer has duplicated rowid
incomplete %>% 
  fixme_find_duplicated_rowid()

incomplete %>% 
  allo_evaluate()
```

### Add equations for each row of your census dataset

The `rowid`s were generated from the row-names of your original census data. Now that you have a single row per `rowid`, you can add the equations to your census data. The two datasets will be joint by matching values of `rowid`.

```{r}
census_equations <- census %>% 
  add_equations(incomplete)

census_equations
```

If you need more information about each equation, `allo_lookup()` helps you to look it up in __allodb__.

```{r}
census_equations %>% 
  allo_lookup(allodb::equations)
```

### Planned enhancements

This section shows pseudo-code: Code that doesn't actually run but shows what it would look like if it did work.

* Add `site` during construction, e.g. `as_species(data, site = "scbi")` and drop the `site` argument to `add_species()`.

```R
census_species <- census %>% 
  add_species(species)
```

* New single interface to automatically calculates biomass.

```R
census_species %>% 
  auto_biomass()
```

* New single interface to automatically add equations to a census dataframe.

```R
census_species %>% 
  auto_equations()
```

* Helper to replace specific equations.

```R
census_species %>% 
  allo_find() %>% 
  allo_replace(
    eqn_id = c("abcd", "efgh"),
    eqn = c("2.0394 * (dbh^2.5715)", "2.0394 * (dbh^2.5715)")
  )
```

### fgeo.biomass and allodb

Allometric equations come from the __allodb__ package.

```{r}
# Internal
fgeo.biomass:::.default_eqn
```

For now we are excluding some equations.

```{r}
# Internal
excluding <- fgeo.biomass:::.bad_eqn_id

allodb::equations %>% 
  filter(equation_id %in% excluding) %>% 
  select(equation_id, equation_allometry)
```
